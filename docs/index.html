    This is a simple Game where your Goal is to win against your Opponent. <br>You can either play against an AI or against another Player with Bouncers that you cant disable.<br> In this Game you win by scoring an amount of Goals that you can choose in the Settings Menu.<br> But be aware that there are Mini-Cannons that shoot at you but prioritize the Lazyball.<br> You can also shoot in this Game using Cannons that are attached to your Ball.
